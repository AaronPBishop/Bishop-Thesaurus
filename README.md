# Bishop's Thesaurus 
is an application that parses user input, before sending an asynchronous fetch request to the official web Dictionary API. The resulting JSON data is keyed into and then compiled into a list and rendered in the virtual DOM with components, using React hooks such as context, state, and effect.

> The API can be found here:
# https://dictionaryapi.dev/

The user's request will return all relevant definitions, synonyms, and antonyms, in a collapsible list style. 

This app was built with React.

> To get started, in your terminal: CD into <bishop-thesaurus>, <npm install>, then <npm start> and make a search!
